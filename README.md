# Mine Explosion Prediction

Coal mine explosions are rare, but they cause the most fatalities. Nearly 8,000 lives have been
lost in US coal mines alone. Worldwide figures are much higher.

There are two main types of coal mine explosions: methane explosions and coal dust explosions.

Methane explosions occur when a buildup of methane gas contacts a heat source and
there is not enough air to dilute the gas level below its explosion point.

Methane is formed as a byproduct of the coal formation. The methane that is adsorbed in the
coal is released as the coal is mined or it migrates from surrounding sources above or below
the coal seam through fractures created by the coal extraction process.

Coal dust is a fine powdered form of coal, which is created by the crushing, grinding, or
pulverizing of coal. Because of the brittle nature of coal, coal dust can be created during
mining, transportation, or by mechanically handling coal. It is a form of fugitive dust.
